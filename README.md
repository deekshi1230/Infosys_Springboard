This folder contains the notebook and results for parsing code snippets using AST, tokenization, and embeddings with MiniLM, DistilRoBERTa, and MPNet.
 Background
In modern NLP and code intelligence, embeddings play a crucial role in representing text or source code as dense vectors.  
This project applies the idea to **Python code snippets**, where we:
1. Parse the code using **Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)** to extract structural information (functions, classes, imports, patterns).
2. Tokenize the raw code into lexical elements.
3. Convert the processed representation into **vector embeddings** using pretrained transformer models.
4. Compare how different models (MiniLM, DistilRoBERTa, MPNet) represent the same code.

This helps us understand:
- Which models capture structural similarity better.
- How embeddings cluster for different types of code snippets.
- Methodology

### Step 1: Code Snippets
We selected **10 Python snippets** that include:
- Functions
- Classes
- Imports
- Loops
- Recursion
- Decorators
- Generators
- Data structures (lists, dicts, trees)

### Step 2: AST Parsing
- Used Pythonâ€™s built-in `ast` module.  
- Extracted:
  - **Functions** (`def ...`)
  - **Classes** (`class ...`)
  - **Imports** (`import ...`, `from ... import ...`)
  - **Patterns**: loops, recursion, decorators, generators  

Example (for a Fibonacci function):
```python
def fib(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    res = []
    for _ in range(n):
        res.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    return res
